Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>\n<p>At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</p>\n<table style=\"width:98.5222%\"><caption><strong>War Domain Spells</strong></caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:26.9488%\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Cleric Level</th>\n<th style=\"width:73.0513%\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:26.9488%\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width:73.0513%\">@Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.ARnk464V6S9QdxsN]{Divine Favor}, @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.ZhB6salYdtBDkUho]{Shield of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:26.9488%\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width:73.0513%\">@Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.APWetQHaoEwUrtOx]{Magic Weapon}, @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.3LkF6xwJHcF2MbOF]{Spiritual Weapon}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:26.9488%\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width:73.0513%\">@Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.GZSkPZ2SFvVC6iFV]{Crusader's Mantle}, @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.TwBeI7CQbh5wL5Rv]{Spirit Guardians}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:26.9488%\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width:73.0513%\">@Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.dnyBRh1xNG35azvT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.Q6qxpjtmMJjWThfI]{Stoneskin}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:26.9488%\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width:73.0513%\">@Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.OMl9wNcpLRpkksP6]{Flame Strike}, @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.IlEFeFCuroaGGcYF]{Hold Monster}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 63","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Cleric 1 (War Domain)","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hRLfj6N96kxBSujt":3},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"quickDesc":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickProperties":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickOther":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickFlavor":{"value":true,"altValue":true}},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ogIFzyt8MNcQPSiL"}}}

through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tools Required</strong></h3>\n<div>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.mlGZDeA8GBcRAdr5]{Thieves' Tools} or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.\n<p>After you gain the @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.class-features.mHepOnPMYzNq7slg]{Infuse Item} feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<div>\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</strong></h3>\n<div>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.\n<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells</strong></h3>\n<div>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.OV8BXuTYgbCafCuV]{Cure Wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h3>\n<div>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</strong></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"> </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</strong></div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Ritual Casting</strong></h3>\n<div>You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<h3><strong>The Magic of Artifice</strong></h3>\n<div>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.OV8BXuTYgbCafCuV]{Cure Wounds} using @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.IWKGrIYLt9kmQSJF]{Alchemist's Supplies}, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.LWuXnbZiDVHkxZ4z]{Tinker's Tools}, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.9N6z8EoYtcAEGX5G]{Poison Spray}, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.\n<p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects.

To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.</p>\n<p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.eVLna3D0AEHn4ihf]{Burning Hands} does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.spells.eVLna3D0AEHn4ihf]{Burning Hands}, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p>\n<p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</p>\n<table><caption><strong>Spells and Ki Points</strong></caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Monk Levels</th>\n<th data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5th-8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">9th-12th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13th-16th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">17th-20th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 80","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Monk 3 (Way of the Four Elements)","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OUGmAvuCIi3KewGn":3},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"quickDesc":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickAttack":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickSave":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickDamage":{"type":"Array","value":[],"altValue":[],"context":[]},"quickProperties":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickCharges":{"type":"Boolean","value":{"use":true,"resource":true,"charge":true},"altValue":{"use":true,"resource":true,"charge":true}},"quickTemplate":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickOther":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true,"context":""},"quickFlavor":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickPrompt":{"type":"Boolean","value":false,"altValue":false}},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.jgT5oyMSsQKQ3tJy"}}}

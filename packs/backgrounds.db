{"name":"Knight of the Order","type":"feat","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-bassinet-kettle-steel.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<div>\n<p>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Though the term \"knight\" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause.</p>\n<p>The \"Knightly Orders of Faerûn\" sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Knightly Orders of Faerûn</strong></h3>\n<div>Many who rightfully call themselves \"knight\" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<blockquote><strong>Knights of the Unicorn.</strong>\n<div>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.\n<p><strong>Knights of Myth Drannor.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.\n<p><strong>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Any one of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.XLtfS3yVnwfjBCiJ]{traveler's clothes}, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.cuAQj7flp8XKW1v8]{pouch} containing 10 gp</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feature: Knightly Regard</strong></h2>\n<div>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims.

You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.</p>\n<p>Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong> Where Are You From?</strong></h3>\n<div>The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><strong> Evermeet.</strong></div>\n<div>The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.\n<p>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong> Halruaa.</strong></div>\n<div>Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic.\n<p>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong> Kara-Tur.</strong></div>\n<div>The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin.\n<p>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong> Mulhorand.</strong></div>\n<div>From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn.\n<p>Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong> Sossal.</strong></div>\n<div>Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white.\n<p>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong> Zakhara.</strong></div>\n<div>As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, \"To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.\" Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have.\n<p>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong> The Underdark.</strong></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<blockquote>Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place - but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child.\n<p>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving \"home\" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.</p>\n<p>You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Insight, Perception</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies: </strong>Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Any one of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.XLtfS3yVnwfjBCiJ]{traveler's clothes}, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.cuAQj7flp8XKW1v8]{pouch} containing 5 gp</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feature: All Eyes on You</strong></h2>\n<div>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign.

These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart.</p>\n<p>As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.</p>\n<h3><strong> Factions of the Sword Coast.</strong></h3>\n<div>The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands.

Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers' ideals.\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<div><strong> The Order of the Gauntlet.</strong></div>\n<div>One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order's ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods.\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<div><strong> The Emerald Enclave.</strong></div>\n<div>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature.\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<div><strong> The Lords' Alliance.</strong></div>\n<div>On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals.\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<div><strong> The Zhentarim.</strong></div>\n<div>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren't necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own—it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\n<h2><strong>Variant Noble (Knight)</strong></h2>\n<p>A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature.</p>\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart-in a chaste sort of devotion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>History, Persuasion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.6jnr4MojyPtGaIsP]{fine clothes}, a @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.jXsCiPqz18hYMMSW]{signet ring}, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feature: Position of Privilege</strong></h2>\n<div>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h2><strong>Variant Feature (Knight): Retainers</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<p>You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. One of your retainers is a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood (This person could be your bond.). Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).</p>\n<p>Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.</p>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3><strong>Suggested Characteristics</strong></h3>\n<div>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself.

He maintains close communication with Aurelia, though recent events in the city have set them at odds. Tajic believes that the Boros can trust only the Boros. He is convinced that any effort at peace among the guilds is doomed to failure without the Guildpact.

Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See the \"Mercenaries of the North\" sidebar for a collection of possibilities.)</p>\n<p>Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mercenaries of the North</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<blockquote>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are smallscale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below.<br /><strong><br />The Chill.<br /></strong>The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few citystates in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization.\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Silent Rain.</strong></div>\n<div>Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>The Bloodaxes.</strong></div>\n<div>Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Persuasion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A uniform of your company (@Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.XLtfS3yVnwfjBCiJ]{traveler's clothes} in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a @Compendium[SharedCompendiums.items.cuAQj7flp8XKW1v8]{pouch} containing the remainder of your last wages (10 gp).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong> Feature: Mercenary Life</strong></h2>\n<div>You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.
